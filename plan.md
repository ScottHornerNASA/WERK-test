## INTRODUCTION
### Project Overview

Wildfire, Ecosystem Resilience, & Risk Assessment Initiative (WERK) is a project conducted under a Reimbursable Space Act Agreement between NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) and the State of California. WERK will provide California agencies with data, data products, and tools to track land use across the state. WERK will also provide decision makers with the information they need to assess the impact of natural and human activity and the regulations and policies that impact the land.

WERK uses publicly available satellite images and California-acquired lidar data to develop timely, updatable, and accurate land cover and change detection maps to improve our understanding of land surface changes in California due to wildfires, forest and fire management, construction, restoration, and other disturbances. This will include tree mapping to differentiate between live and dead tree canopies and evaluate the health of the forests, as well as fire risk and built structure mapping to support public safety, disaster preparedness, and disaster response.

### Purpose of Document

This document provides a brief overview of the project and how it will be managed at ARC.

### Goals

The goals of the WERK project are to:
- Track vegetation management and restoration progress in support of wildfire prevention and ecosystem resilience statewide.
- Equip state and federal decision makers with geospatial information relevant to California-wide resilience, biodiversity conservation, and wildfire risk reduction targets.
- Provide transparent, defensible, updatable data and analysis in support of good governance and long-term project sustainment.

### Partnership Agreement

This project is funded through a Reimbursable Space Act Agreement between NASA Ames Research Center and the California Natural Resources Agency (CNRA). The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is a named partner in the Reimbursable Space Act Agreement.

## Management approach

### Overview

#### Project Classification

This project does not have a NASA mission classification. It is a science data product and software project funded through a Reimbursable Space Act Agreement. To facilitate the software release process, the software released and delivered by WERK will be classified as Class D under the definition in the NASA Software Engineering Requirements, 7120.2D Appendix D.

#### Key Personnel

| Key Personnel | Affiliation | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Scott Horner** | ARC | Project Manager |
| **Taejin Park** | BAERI | Project Scientist |
| **Ian Brosnan** | ARC | WERK RSAA Technical POC |

#### Reporting

The Project Manager will prepare a monthly financial report and deliver it to the NASA Earth eXchange (NEX) Project Scientist for incorporation into the SG reporting stream. NASA, BAERI, and other grantees and contractors provide monthly financial reports to the Deputy Project Manager who compiles the information into a WERK financial report.

### Project WBS

WERK has a single project WBS and will not use the complete NASA work-breakdown structure. While the project will have project management, systems engineering, mission assurance, science, and public outreach, it is a small project and it would not be useful or efficient to track work by these categories.

### Roles and Responsibilities

The project is led by a Project Manager (PM) who is responsible for the successful implementation of the project. The Project Scientist (PS) is responsible for the scientific integrity and scientific success of the project as an integral part of achieving overall project success. The Project Scientist and Project Manager work as partners to ensure project success and collaborate and coordinate with the California Natural Resources Agency and the California Air Resources Board.
